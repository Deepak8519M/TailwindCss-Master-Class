<!-- 
Design3 is a simple HTML page that demonstrates a glowing button effect. The
button is styled with CSS to have a glowing circle effect when hovered over. The
glow effect is achieved using a radial gradient background and a blur filter.
The button and glow circle are positioned using absolute positioning within a
relative container. The glow circle appears behind the button when hovered over,
creating an eye-catching effect. The JavaScript file (script.js) is included but
not provided in this snippet. -->
